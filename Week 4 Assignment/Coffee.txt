I was drinking coffee went I decided to name the file.  arrays to store linear collec-tions of elements. You can use a two-dimensional array to store a matrix or a table. Each row in a two-dimensional array is itself an array. Thus, the rows can have different lengths. An array of this kind is known as a ragged array. Here is an example of creating a ragged array: For example, the following table that lists the distancesIf you don’t know the values in a ragged array in advance, but do know the sizes—say, the same as before—you can create a ragged array using the following syntax:  between cities can be stored using a two-dimensional array named distances. How do you declare a variable for two-dimensional arrays? How do you create a two-dimensional array? How do you access elements in a two-dimensional array? This section addresses these issues. A two-dimensional array is actually an array in which each element is a one-dimensional array. The length of an array x is the number of elements in the array, which can be obtained using x.length. x[0], x[1], . . . , and x[x.length-1] are arrays. Their lengths can be obtained using x[0].length, x[1].length, . . . , and x[x.length-1].length. For example, suppose x = new int[3][4],x[0],x[1], and x[2] are one-dimensional arrays and each contains four elements, as shown in Figure 8.2. x.length is 3, and x[0].length,x[1].length, and x[2].length are 4.
